The open-source low-voltage grid reference system is designed for the MATLAB Simulink environment and incorporate both non-controllable and controllable components, such as PVs, HPs, boilers and EVs. As the controllable components are still in development, these will be investigated in subsequent research. Solely the non-controllable components were imple-mented to construct various low-voltage topologies combined with different load/generation scenarios.
