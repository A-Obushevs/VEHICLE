<div style="text-align: justify"> The open-source low-voltage grid reference system is designed for the MATLAB Simulink environment and incorporate both non-controllable, such as PVs, HPs, boilers and EVs. As the controllable components are still in development, these will be investigated in subsequent research. Solely the non-controllable components were implemented to construct various low-voltage topologies combined with different load/generation scenarios. These scenarios, also called cases, were then investigated, verified and validated by running them in a real-time environment in an OPAL-RT setup. The simulation results extracted from the Simulink OPAL-RT system were then validated by comparing them to real-field measurement data which were obtained during two visits at [SYSLAB, DTU Risø Campus](https://wind.dtu.dk/facilities/powerlabdk-facilities/syslab) in Denmark (February April/May 2022) as part of the ‘VEHICLE’ [ERIGRID 2.0](https://zenodo.org/communities/erigrid2) project. A physical exchange was conducted to implement predefined low-voltage topologies in the physical adjustable low-voltage grid at SYSLAB DTU, with which various tests were conducted in order to acquire real-field measurements in high resolution (e.g. 1 second values of U, I, P, Q). </div>
